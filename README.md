Apertus Disk Drive (ADD) immutably stores data as cryptocurrency on blockchains

ADD is an open source client that enables read-write data functionality to any crypto coin wallet that support bitcoin's standard set of RPC commands. (ex BTC, LTC...)  When connected to a wallet ADD monitors and creates a coin agnostic, web browseable index of the data stored by other ADD clients in near realtime.  Data can be a combination of UTF8 Text and 1 or many binary files.  ADD uses a Ledger system to allow unlimited file counts and file sizes to be grouped and accessed by a single transaction id.

NOTE: Coins used in the saving process are not recoverable.
