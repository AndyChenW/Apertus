  <h2>Apertus Instructions</h2>
    <P>Apertus can support most coins with the proper settings; we have pre-loaded the settings for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Mazacoin, and Anoncoin.</P>
   <br>


  <h3>I. Synchronize your Wallet(s)</h3>
    <p>Apertus requires the full wallet/blockchain of the coin you are archiving on.<p>
    <p>~Download the full wallet (and thus the blockchain) of the coin. (ex. go to Bitcoin.org, click “Get Started with Bitcoin”, then click “Choose your wallet”, download & run “Bitcoin Core”)</p>
    <p>~Fully synchronize your wallet before you begin.</p>
    <p>This process may take some time. Bitcoin is largest, but also the best chance of your data surviving over time. If you are looking for quicker results, try the other coins.</p>
    <p>~After the coin(s) have fully synchronized, the wallet needs the RPC (remote procedure calls) enabled. A special file called a configuration file, aka, "conf" file needs to be created and placed in a certain spot. </p>
   <br>

  <h3>II. Conf File Instructions: </h3>
    <p>1. Shut down your synced coin wallet.</p>
    <p>2. Open Notepad (located in programs/accessories).</p>
    <p>3. Copy the following code:<br>
       server=1<br>
       rpcuser=<br>
       rpcpassword=</p>
    <p>4. Paste into your Notepad file.</p>
    <p>5. After rpcuser= put any user name you want (spaces are not allowed).</p>
    <p>6. After prcpassword= put any password you want (spaces are not allowed).</p>
    <p>7. The configuration file must be placed into a special folder associated with your wallet. (go to 8 if you haven’t done this before) <br>
       Example: C:\Users\[your user name]\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\bitcoin.conf<br>
       Example: C:\Users\[your user name]\AppData\Roaming\Litecoin\litecoin.conf</p>
    <p>8. Go to File, click "Save As”.</p>
    <p>9. At the bottom, change "Save as type" to "All Files".</p>
    <p>10. Enter bitcoin.conf under file name. (or corresponding coin name)</p>
    <p>11. Click on "Local Disk" (usually on the far left, towards the bottom), then "users", then <yourusername>, then "AppData", then "Roaming."<p>
    <p>~You may need to enable the viewing of hidden folders and files to see the AppData Folder. <br>
       (this process is different for each version of windows, google this process if need be)<br>
       (windows 7 example: Start button - Control Panel - Appearance and Personalization - Show hidden files and folders - Remove the checkmark from the checkbox labeled “Hide extensions for known file types.”  Remove the checkmark from the checkbox labeled “Hide protected operating system files.”)</p>
    <p>12. Click save. (keep the file open on your desktop for now)</p>
   <br>

  <h3>III. Wallet Configuration Instructions</h3>

    <p>1. Restart your coin wallet, wait for it to re-sync (will be quicker this time)</p>
    <p>2. Open Apertus.</p>
    <p>3. When open, click "Settings", then click "wallet".</p>
    <p>4. Select the wallet you want from the top pulldown menu "Select Wallet From List".</p>
    <p>5. At the bottom, change the  "RPC User" info to the user name you created in the conf file.</p>
    <p>6. Change the "RPC Password" info to the password you created.</p>
    <p>7. At the bottom, make sure "Enable Wallet" is check-marked.</p>
    <p>8. Click save in the upper right corner.</p>
    <p>9. Restart Apertus (exit all Apertus files, exit Apertus, re-start Apertus)</p>
    <p>Apertus is now ready to read and write data on the coins blockchain.</p>
   <br>

  <h3>IV. Monitor and Search the Blockchain(s)</h3>

    <p>Prior to archiving, you may want to monitor and or search the blockchain(s) for data.  This will help you see that it is working.</p>
    <p>1. Ensure you have fully synchronized your coin, and you have rebooted it since making the conf file.</p>
    <p>2. Ensure you have rebooted Apertus after you set the configurations for the coin. </p>
    <p>3. Click the "Explore" tab in Apertus.</p>
    <p>4. Copy and paste the transaction id of a known archive into the box labled “ENTER TRANSACTION ID”, Hit Enter.  If found the archive will be displayed in the explorer window.</p>
    <p>5. To begin monitoring  check the "Monitor Blockchains" check box<br>
       NOTE: (the checkmark may not show up right away, click once, wait, possibly a few seconds, don’t click multiple times, it may take a moment or two.)</P>
    <p>6. Apertus is now monitoring the blockchain(s) for data.</p>
   <br>

  <h3> V. Archiving </h3>
    <p>1. Apertus uses small amounts of coin to immutably embed data onto blockchains; you will need to put some into your wallet for this to work. (we get none of this btw, it is “burned” onto the blockchain, and will be lost to time. In the event of a mistake, we recommended you don’t use your primary wallet as a safety precaution)</p>
    <p>2. Ensure your have fully synchronized your coin and rebooted it since making the conf file.</p>
    <p>3. Ensure you have have restarted Apertus after you set the configurations for the coin.</p>
    <p>4. At the bottom of the archive screen, click "Select Wallet"
    <p>5. Select the wallet you are using.</p>
    <p>6. Click "Select Account".</p>
    <p>7. Select the account you want to use. If you haven't named your accounts in your wallet, it may appear as blank, click the blank area.</p>
    <p>8. Go to the large main area where it says "ENTER MESSAGE HERE" - click on it.</p>
    <p>9. Enter your message there, and/or add a file using the "attach" feature.</p>
    <p>10. Click "SAVE" on the far right. (Have patience for files larger than 3K)</p>
    <p>You’ve just put immutable data on a Blockchain</p>
   <br>

  <h3>VI. Signing your archives</h3>
    <p>Signing an archive proves the archivist owns the signing address and that the data returned to the client matches the data archived by the signee.  It does this by creating a SHA256 HASH of the entire archive.  The HASH is passed in as a message to the wallets signing function to create a signature.  The signature and signing address is then attached to the archive for verification by other clients.   Signing your archives allows other Apertus users to trust , follow and find your archives.  </p>
    <p>1. Under the “Settings” tab, click “Wallets.”</p>
    <p>2. In the new window, select the wallet you are working with from the pull down menu.</p>
    <p>3. Copy and paste the address you would like to use for signing in the box labeled “Signing Address”<br>
       NOTE: The address must exist within the connected wallet.</p>
    <p>4. Check the “Enable Signing” checkbox.</p>
    <p>5. Click Save.</p>

   <br>
           <!-- formatting could possibly use work for Trust Center and Adding a Coin -->

  <h3>VII. Trust Center</h3>
    <p>The trust center allows users to trust or block content archived onto blockchains  by establishing  trusted or blocked address lists.  To add an address to either list, copy and paste the address into the input field located at the top of either list box and click the + button.  Click the – button to remove the address from the list.  Trust options can be adjusted by checking the various option boxes located below each address list.</P>
    <p>Trust Center Options:</p>
    <p>~Accept all content from Trusted Address List.<br>
       Any archives signed by a trusted address will bypass  Apertus’s default security features ex.(html formatting and scripting, executable files) 
    <p>~Block all content from Blocked Address List.<br>
       Any archives signed by a blocked address will not be written to disk. A transaction ID not found message will be displayed if attempting to explore a blocked address.</p>
    <p>~Block all untrusted content.<br>
       Any archive not signed by an address listed in the Trusted address list will not be written to disk.  A transaction ID not found message will be displayed if attempting to explore a untrusted address.</p>
    <p>~Block all unsigned content.<br>
       Archives that have not been signed will not be written to disk.  A transaction ID not found message will be displayed if attempting to explore a unsigned transaction.</p>

   <br>


  <h3>How to Increase Transaction Fee, aka Parking Fee</h3>
    <p>The immutability (unprunability) of Apertus comes from the fact that it deposits small amounts of unrecoverable coin per 20 bytes of data. <br>
       This makes a blockchain permanently bigger and puts a burden on miners and pool operators.<br>
       Apertus has adjustable settings that allow you to increase miner fees if you want to assess yourself a fee to offset this burden.</p>
    <p>1. Under the “Settings” tab, click “Wallets.”</p>
    <p>2. In the new box, select the wallet you are working with from the pull down menu.
    <p>3. Under Transaction Fee change the setting to any larger amount you want.<br>
       Ex. if it is set at 0.0001, you can increase it by a factor of 10 by setting it to 0.001
    <p>4. Click Save.</p>

   <br>

  <h3> How to upgrade Apertus:</h3>
    <p>1. Download the newest version.</p>
    <p>2. Copy the entire contents of the folder (control-a, then right-click, click "copy")</p>
    <p>3. Paste the contents into the old Apertus folder (may require a search to find the original folder)</p>
    <p>4. When prompted, click "copy and replace.”</p>

   <br>

  <h3> Adding a Coin </h3>
    <p>~ Wallet must be synced prior to installing on Apertus.
    <p>~ On the main Apertus page go to 'Settings' then click on 'Wallet Settings.
    <p>~ Click the down arrow on 'Select Wallet From List.'
    <p>~ If you don't see your coins name, click any of the coins to begin customizing a new one.
    <p>~ Go to 'Wallet Name' and enter the name of the coin you are installing.
    <p>~ Click the tab 'Copy'. The name will show up in the list.
    <p>~ Enter the relavent data on this list:
    <br>

    <p>- Version Byte<br>
       ~ Figure out what the leading character is in the coin's address. <br>
       ~ Find it on the chart at https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/List_of_address_prefixes. <br>
       ~ Look to the left at the 'Decimal version.' This is your Version Byte.<br> 	
       ~ If it gives you an address that you don't even use and tells you it's invalid, that means you have the Version Byte wrong. (there are a few options possible, try another one on the list)</p>

    <p>- Payload Size<br>
       ~ This is done by digging in the code for the numbers OR experimentation. Enter a number close to what is defauted on Bitoin. Apertus will help, read the error & change as needed.</p>

    <p>- Transaction Size <br>
       ~ this is done by digging in the code for the numbers OR experimentation. Enter a number close to what is defauted on Bitoin. Apertus will help, read the error & change as needed.</p>

    <p>- Transaction fee<br>
       ~ this is done by digging in the code for the numbers OR experimentation. Enter a number close to what is defauted on Bitoin. Apertus will help, read the error & change as needed.</p>

    <p>- Min Transaction<br>
       ~ this is done by digging in the code for the numbers OR experimentation. Enter a number close to what is defauted on Bitoin. Apertus will help, read the error & change as needed. <br>
       ~ If it says "transaction amount too small", increase Min Transaction.<br>

    <p>- RPC Port<br>
       ~ Dig in the code for it, or:<br>
       ~ Exit your coin.<br>
       ~ Goto the command prompt and type netstat /a<br>
       ~ Write down or copy/paste all the listening ports you see. (mark, copy (enter), paste into notepad).<br>
       ~ Restart your coin then enter netstat /a into the command prompt again.<br>
       ~ Look for the a new 0.0.0.0:XXXXX  If there are two of them, try both. One of them is it.<br>
       ~ If it says "Check Wallet Settings. Value cannot be null." That usually means your RPC Port is wrong (each coin can open 2 RPC IP ports, but only one of them make Apertus go, try the other one) OR you didn't do your Conf File properly.</p>

    <p>- RCP IP<br>
       ~ 127.0.0.1 for every coin so far.</p>

    <p>- RPC User RPC Password<br>
       ~ see Conf File Instructions.

    <p>- Signing Address<br>
       ~ Depends on your usage needs; see Signing your Archives.</p>
    
    <p>- Troubleshooting Adding a Coin:<br>
       ~ If it says "Check Wallet Settings. Value cannot be null." That usually means your RPC Port is wrong (each coin can open 2 RPC IP ports, but only one of them make Apertus go, try the other one) OR you didn't do your Conf File properly.<br>
       ~ If it gives you an address that you don't even use and tells you it's invalid, that means you have the Version Byte wrong. (there are a few options possible, try another one on the list)<br>
       ~ If it says "transaction amount too small", increase Min Transaction.</p>

   <br>
 
  <h3>Notes on Safety:</h3>
    <p>~ Apertus uses small amounts of coin to immutably embed data onto blockchains; you will need to put some into your wallet for this to work. We recieve none of this, it is etched onto the blockchain as unspendable transaction outputs in patterned data. In the event of a mistake, we recommended you don’t use your primary wallet as a safety precaution, and with a low cost of coins to work with </p>

    <p>~ By default, Apertus attempts to Filter out all Unsafe Content. Treat any posting you see with the same caution you would use with unknown emails. When monitoring blockchains, do not download or run executable files from sources you have not verified. We haven’t seen any malicious content yet, it is inevitable, but perhaps humans can change. </p>
